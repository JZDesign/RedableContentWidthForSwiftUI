# Redable Content Width For SwiftUI

Apple added a layout guide to UIKit that was meant to make reading text easier. I found that there is no equivalent in AppKit or SwiftUIâ€¦ but years ago I stumbled upon a blog that cleverly used UIKit to provide the layout guide to SwiftUI on devices that support UIKit. 

I decided to go a step further and support other platforms too with a secondary implementation.
